      "answers": {
        "a": "0 =< FX(x) =< 1 for every x.",
        "b": "F_{X}(x)=0 when x tends to infinty.",
        "c": "F_{X}(x) is non-decreasing",
        "d": "P(X>x)=1-FX(x)"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "By definiition CDF is P(X=<x) hence lies between 0 and 1.",
        "b": "F_{X}(x)=1 when x tends to infinty because F_{X}(x)=P(X=<x).",
        "c": " CDF is the summation of the Probabilities of discrete random variables. So CDF is always non-decreasing with finitely many jump-discontinuities.",
        "d": "F_{X}(x)=P(X=<x)=1-P(X>x)"
